This app utilizes TwitterAPI https://github.com/geduldig/TwitterAPI

This is a quick and simple program that will upload and post an entire folder of images to a twitter account

You will require an application account for your profile which will include a consumer key and access token

Once the parameters are defined and the program is started it will run until all the images in the folder have been posted, keeping track of previous runs
